# Meet4Eat

**Meet4Eat** is a social collaboration application providing an easy way to communicate with your colleagues and friends to make an appointment for a social event such as meeting for daily lunch.

For more details visit the website https://m4e.org


**Installation**
This package is self-contained and needs no real installation. Now where you have extracted the tar.bz2 package you only need to execute the shell script Meet4Eat.sh. This script will setup the binaries and create an application and auto-start entry, which should work on many linux distributions such as Ubuntu. From now on you can find and start the application Meet4Eat in your desktop search area. If not disabled by Meet4Eat's system tray menu, it will start automatically after your login into desktop.

Note that if you move the package directory then you must start the shell script once by hand in order to update the application entry.
